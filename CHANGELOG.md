## Changelog

### 4.0.0-pp (2021-05-07)
- Improvements:
    - Changed Config API call to be a /GET with query params. This allows the backend to filter requests if required. [SDKCF-3652]
    - Added handling for "429 Too Many Requests" response to Config/Ping API requests. When status code 429 is received by the SDK it will start expontential backoff (plus a random factor) retries to space out the requests to the backend. [SDKCF-3654]
    - Campaign opt-out & max impression tracking logic is now handled solely on client side. This change reduces the backend's load per request. [SDKCF-3656]
    - Added support for rollout percentage value received in Config API response. This allows the backend to gradually increase campaign distribution. [SDKCF-3663]
    - Added subscription key in Config API request header to enable better filtering of requests. [SDKCF-3716]
- Bug fixes:
    - Fixed rarely occurring threading crashes in dependency manager by using a static queue for access. [SDKCF-3646]
